                    <strong>Submission Reminder App</strong>
                    <p>
                        A Bash-based application designed to help users keep track of important submission deadlines. The app leverages cron jobs and environment configuration to send timely reminders, ensuring that users never miss a deadline. This project demonstrates my ability to automate tasks and improve productivity through scripting.
