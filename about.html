            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Agnes Mbabazi, and I am a dedicated software engineer based in Kigali, Rwanda. With a keen interest in technology and problem-solving, I have developed a strong foundation in software development, working on a variety of projects that have challenged and inspired me.
            </p>
            <p>
     I recently completed my Advanced Level studies at IFAK DON BOSCO, specializing in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics (PCM). My academic journey has given me a strong foundation in science and analytical thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am active in volunteering, youth leadership, and enjoy participating in extracurricular activities such as basketball, drawing, and dancing. I am eager to continue learning, growing, and contributing to my community and the world of science and technology.
            <p>
                Outside of coding, I enjoy mentoring aspiring developers, participating in tech communities, and exploring new advancements in the field. I am always eager to take on new challenges and contribute to impactful projects.
            </p>
